# anchr

> **Note**: This project is currently under active development.

`anchr` is a low-level Linux daemon exposing bound disk partitions via a QUIC-based abstraction layer, designed for high-performance communication with the `rfs` service. It is designed for secure internal usage and will eventually form the foundational layer for encrypted file access across a private infrastructure.

## ⚠️ Status: Experimental

This project is in an early, **heavily experimental** stage.

- ❌ **Issues and pull requests are not accepted** at this time.
- 🔧 **Breaking changes** can and will occur frequently without notice.
- 🧪 Intended for internal testing and development only.

## 🚧 Use at your own risk

If you choose to experiment with `anchr`, please understand that:

- APIs may change drastically at any time.
- Configurations and behaviors are not stable.
- There is no guarantee of functionality or backward compatibility.

We appreciate your interest, but we recommend waiting for a stable release if you require a reliable system.
